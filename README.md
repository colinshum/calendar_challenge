# Javascript Calendar Challenge

## Setup

```
$ git clone https://github.com/colinshum/calendar_challenge.git
$ cd calendar_challenge
$ open index.html
```

## Description 

A Full Stack calendar coding challenge that is limited to Vanilla Javascript only. 

## Guidelines 

- The arrow buttons on the left and right should move to the previous and next months, respectively.
- Use plain JavaScript; no jQuery, React, or other libraries.
- Don't worry about browser compatibility (just make sure it renders in the latest version of Google Chrome).
- Don't be too concerned with responsive behavior. We won't judge if it doesn't look great on mobile.
